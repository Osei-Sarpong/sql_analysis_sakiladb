# Sakila Movie Database Analysis
This project analyzes the Sakila Database. The database pertains to a DVD rental store and I make use of PostGreSQL to extract the kind of tables I will need to draw insights and excel to make the visualisations to communicate my insights.

# Description
The Sakila Database contains an immense chunk of data, one that a large movie rental corporation would usually keep. It consists of multiple tables covering various aspects of a DVD rental business, including films, actors, customers, rentals, payments, and staff which can be used to draw insights to improve business understanding of key aspects of their business such as customer behavior, film popularity, revenue generation, and store performance.

# Resources used
I make use of the Sakila Database which can be found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html) 
I also use PostgreSQL to run my queries and Microsoft Excel to create my visualizations.
