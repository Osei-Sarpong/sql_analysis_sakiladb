# Sakila Movie Database Analysis
This project analyzes the Sakila Database. The database pertains to a DVD rental store and I make use of PostgreSQL to extract the kind of tables I will need to draw insights and Excel to make the visualizations to communicate my insights.

# Description
The Sakila Database contains an immense chunk of data, one that a large movie rental corporation would usually keep. It consists of multiple tables covering various aspects of a DVD rental business, including films, actors, customers, rentals, payments, and staff which can be used to draw insights to improve business understanding of key aspects of their business such as customer behavior, film popularity, revenue generation, and store performance.

The four questions asked in this project are as follows:
* For the movie rating that recorded the most rentals, which customers rented the most (top ten)?
* For a customer (Terry Carlson), how much was spent in total based on ratings?
* For a category (Action movies), which were the top rented movies(top ten)?
* How much did our top customers spend on a particular category (drama)?

# Resources used
